* Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#

(you choose whatever region you want - I chose Ohio)
* Choose **Create stack**
* On the create a stack page, find **Amazon S3 URL*** adn enter the URL below & next

  <summary> 5. Create Elastic IPs for you worker Nodes </summary>

  **Estimated Cost:**  your basically charged for them when they aren't attached to any running worker nodes.
                 $0.005 per IP address associated with a running instance per hour on a pro rata basis

  <summary> 6. Create Worker Nodes </summary>
  
  **Estimated Cost:** Hourly cost of running the ec2 servers

#### This section builds woker nodes in the VPC using a Cloudformation Script,  then attaches them to the EKS CLuster

* Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#

(you choose whatever region you want - I chose Ohio)
* Choose **Create stack**
* On the create a stack page, find **Amazon S3 URL*** adn enter the URL below & next
* Enter a Stack Name ```   EKS-sample-vpc    ``` ``` Next ```   ``` Next ```  ``` Create Stack ```

  The AWS CloudFormation node template:

###  Filling out the form:
The **ClusterName** in your node AWS CloudFormation template must **exactly match** the name of the cluster you want your nodes to join


**TROUBLESHOOTING** the cloudformation script (because you do everything perfectly - everytime!)
* The node is not tagged as being owned by the cluster. Your nodes must have the following tag applied to them, where <cluster-name> is replaced with the name of your cluster.
  

|Key	|Value|
|:-|:-|
|kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster-name> | owned|


* The nodes may not be able to access the cluster using a public IP address. Ensure that nodes deployed in public subnets are assigned a public IP address. If not, you can associate an elastic IP address to a node after it's launched.
